# Lead Card Navigation Fix

## Issue Identified
The lead card navigation was showing "Not Found" errors when clicking on lead cards to view lead details.

## Root Cause
The problem was caused by duplicate route definitions in `client/src/App.tsx`:

```jsx
// These duplicate routes were interfering with the parametric route
<Route path="/leads" component={() => <Leads />} />
<Route path="/dashboard/leads" component={() => <Leads />} />
```

These routes were defined after the correct parametric route `/dashboard/leads/:leadId`, causing the router to match the generic `/dashboard/leads` route instead of the parametric one.

## Solution Implemented

1. **Removed Duplicate Routes**: Eliminated the conflicting route definitions at lines 438-439 in `App.tsx`

2. **Added Debugging Logs**: Added console logging to track navigation attempts:
   ```jsx
   onClick={() => {
     console.log('Navigating to lead:', lead.id);
     window.location.href = `/dashboard/leads/${lead.id}`;
   }}
   ```

3. **Verified Route Structure**: The correct route structure is now:
   ```jsx
   <Route path="/dashboard/leads">
     <ProtectedRoute>
       <DashboardLayout>
         <Leads />
       </DashboardLayout>
     </ProtectedRoute>
   </Route>
   <Route path="/dashboard/leads/:leadId">
     <ProtectedRoute>
       <DashboardLayout>
         <LeadDetails />
       </DashboardLayout>
     </ProtectedRoute>
   </Route>
   ```

## Files Modified

### client/src/App.tsx
- Removed duplicate route definitions for `/leads` and `/dashboard/leads`
- Maintained proper route ordering with specific routes before catch-all

### client/src/pages/dashboard/leads.tsx  
- Added console logging for debugging navigation
- Enhanced click handlers in both card view and dropdown menus

## Testing Results
- Lead card navigation now works correctly
- API endpoints are responding properly (confirmed 200 status on `/api/leads/:id`)
- LeadDetails component loads and displays lead information correctly
- Both card click and dropdown menu navigation function as expected

## Technical Notes
- The `LeadDetails` component exists and is properly implemented
- Backend API endpoints are functioning correctly
- Issue was purely frontend routing configuration
- Navigation uses `window.location.href` for full page navigation
- Wouter router requires specific routes to be defined before generic ones

## Resolution Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Lead card navigation now opens the correct lead details page without "Not Found" errors.
